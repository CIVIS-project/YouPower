# CIVIS frontend

This is the frontend of the CIVIS project.

## Setup

```
cd frontend/            # move into correct directory
npm install -g bower cordova ionic gulp
                        # install necessary tools for build
npm install             # install build dependencies
bower install           # install clientside dependencies
gulp                    # builds frontend
ionic serve             # start web server
```

This will launch a preview of the application in your default web browser.
Running `ionic serve --lab` will simulate different mobile platforms for
testing.
